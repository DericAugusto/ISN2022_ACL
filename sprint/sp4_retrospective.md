# Sprint 4 (final) retrospective

1. **Add several levels to the game:** It was possible to add 3 levels to the game that work well. Enemies are able to attack as well as the hero, who has the high attack and the normal attack. Each level has its own background and each enemy has its own special characteristics.

2. **Add music and noises to the game:** There are different sounds for each attack and each enemy, for collecting items, as well as sounds for transitions between stages. The theme songs, however, were missing. There is a theme song on the opening screen but not on the other screens.

3. **Development of full screen settings:** the goal of setting the screen to fullscreen mode at the 1920x1080 aspect ratio has been successfully achieved.

4. **Hero attack features:** the hero is able to perform all the proposed attacks.

5. **Enemy attacks:** Each of the 3 different enemies created is capable of performing simple attacks, each with its own special characteristic.So the goal was achieved in its completeness.

6. **Final boss:** It was not completed, as only three different levels were developed, not including the final boss.

7. **New camera system centered on the hero:** Overall the goal was achieved. The only error occurs when the hero moves to the edge of the screen on the left, reaching a region where there is no background.
