- We finished all the tasks we had to do because everybody has done what he was supposed to do
- We have good relationships and everybody is interested in the project: sometimes we helped each other in our personal tasks.
- We listened carefully all the advices and we succeeded
- Now that everybody is able to code and understand the project, we can advance to a better game quality, for exemple with more beautiful assets (sounds more approtiate and high quality pictures) or more complete features 
- We should improve our division of tasks: sometimes some member of the group do something that an other member is supposed to do.
