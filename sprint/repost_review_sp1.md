we met a lot of issues:
    - the use of Java (new language for a group member)
    - errors of compilation in Visual Studio Code
    - difference of import between WindowsOS and MacOS
    - understanding the different libraries
    - the methodology of project (diagrame use-cases, backlog)
    - defining the game's concept

Also, we didn't have the time to make the character jump. Therefore, we are going to do this functionality during the next sprint.
