## general idea

- the game looks like street fighter: computer fights against the user

- the hero must also be able to attack and defend
- finally the hero must be able to pick up items which will give it to him power, health...

## background

- we will hear music while we are playing
- different sound for different action 

## scenerey

- fighters are walking, jumping, running... on the ground 

## item

- can be collected or dispensed by the hero
- when collected (one by one), the items gives to the hero a new power
